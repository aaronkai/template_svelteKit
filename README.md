# Sveltekit + Typescipt + TailwindCSS + stylelint

The intention is for this to be a handy template for me to grab and go.

## Notes for future Aaron

- Recall that app.css is a postcss file that is the global styles for this template. _@apply_ rulessets that you wish to apply globally can be inserted here.

- Meanwhile, custom colors are set in tailwind.config.js

-I added the Dracula color palate via npm package and plugin via tailwind.config.cjs
